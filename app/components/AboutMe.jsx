                    Hey! I'm Aman Singh, a passionate Software Developer with hands-on experience and a strong understanding of full-stack web development. I specialize in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), Next.js, and TypeScript, and I can quickly adapt to other frameworks.
                    <br /><br />
                    With over a year of experience, Iâ€™ve built and deployed efficient and scalable applications, focusing on performance and user-friendly design principles. Driven by a passion for continuous learning, I'm always exploring new technologies and expanding my knowledge base.
                    <br /><br />
                    When I'm not coding, I enjoy watching videos and read articles about external affairs and geopolitics , or playing cricket ðŸ”´ or spending quality time with friends.
