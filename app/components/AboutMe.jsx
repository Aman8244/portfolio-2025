                    Hey! I'm Abdul Rahman, I've been close to a computer since an early age, and been passionate about it ever since.
                    <br /> <br />
                    I really liked to build stuff using no-code tools
                    back in 2010, and from that, I explored how to code myself, fast-forward to today, I do programming in various languages and technologies, and had the privilege to worked in a Recruitment Company
                    and a SaaS Company <br />
                    I'm interested in building something awesome with code and automate tasks with code, currently focused on Web & Mobile Development,
                    Open Source
                    and Competitive Programming
                    <br /><br />
                    When I'm not coding I play games with my friends, watch some show on Netflix, or if the weather's good, play basketball! üèÄ
